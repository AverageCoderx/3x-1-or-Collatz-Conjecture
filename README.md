# 3x-1-or-Collatz-Conjecture
This python program tests any number using the Collatz Conjecture Rules. And gives additional information.


Lets explain the simple rules of this math game.
1)Pick a number any number.
2)If the number is even divide it by two.
3)If the number is odd multiply by 3 then add 1.
4)keep following these steps.

If you do this a few times you notice that all the numbers end in
a 4, 2, 1 loop. The Collatz Conjecture says that all numbers will
end in this loop. Using this program you enter any number and it will
follow the rules and tell you how many steps it took to get to the
4, 2, 1 loop and the biggest number. Do you think you can find a number
that proves the Collatz Conjecture wrong?
